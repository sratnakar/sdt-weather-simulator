# sdt-toy-simulator

It is a java library for weather simulation. This library was implemented using Yahoo Weather API. The simulator takes the input from a text file, which contains the WOEID codes for different locations and outputs the data in the below form:

Location|Lattitude,Longitude,Elevation|Time|Condition|Temperature|Pressure|humidity

where,<br />
Location refers to the location for which WOEID is given,<br />
Lattitude,Longitude,Elevation - are comma separated triple set showing the lattitude,longitude and elevation of the location <br />
Time - which is in ISO 8601 format date time <br />
Condition - Either this is Rain,Sunny and Snow <br />
Temperature - which is in C <br />
Pressure - which is in hpa <br />
Humidity - which is in % <br />

<h3> How to run the simulator: </h3>
Build the project by the following commands

$ mvn compile <br />
$ mvn package <br />
$ java -jar "path to this jar - \target\sdt-toy-simulator-2.0.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" "path/of/input text file" <br />

<h4>Note: </h4> If a text file is not given as an input then by default few locations names have been given as input hence data pertaining to those will be printed.

<h3>Input:</h3>

The input for the simulator is a text file - A list with set of locations or lat,long values. For Example refer to the below sample <br /> 

22.54994,88.37158 <br />
7.0077,100.47053  <br />
hyderabad  <br />
55.74164,37.60506  <br />
dubai  <br />
punjab   <br />
32.1685,-95.66919  <br />
Sydney <br />
Melbourne <br />

where, <br />
Melbourne - is the location name <br />
22.54994,88.37158 - lattitude,longitude values<br />

<h3>Output:</h3>
